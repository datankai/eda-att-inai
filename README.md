Exploratory Data Analysis for Personal Data granted by AT&amp;T byway of INAI

# Intro
Some famous journalists have approached Datank.ai for help with an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset they obtained through a lawsuit before INAI to demand "all their personal data" from AT&T, their phone carrier.

This EDA will serve as backing for an article written by these journalists pointing out the flaws and defficiencies of our country's Personal Privacy Protection Law, and how our data and these loopholes can help unethical or questionable intentions, which become more important as we approach the federal elections of 2018.

Datank.ai has a CSR practice that aims to bring Data Science talent to topics and areas of public interest. As such, this collaboration aims to deliver either an RMD HTML document or a Python Notebook that:

1. Imports a PDF and converts it into a Data Frame.
2. Performs exploration on this Data Frame, according to our Chief Scientist's Methodology and Requirements ().
3. Poses interesting questions and tries to answer them.
4. Is highly graphical, but explains each plot or chart clearly and relates it to the questions at hand.
5. Uses plotly for the charts in this EDA.
6. Draws meaningful conclusions.
